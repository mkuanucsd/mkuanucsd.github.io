# About Me

I am a **Computer Science** major from *San Francisco, California* currently attending the University of California, San Diego.
I like to spend my free time solving capture the flags. ***My main coding language is Java***, but I enjoy using C++ when I want to reverse engineer programs. Click here to go to my [Contact Information](#contact).

## Capture the Flag

My favorite site for finding capture the flag problems is [CrackMes](https://www.crackmes.one/)!\
I recommend checking out these programs if you want to get into reverse engineering:\
[IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/)\
![ida](images/ida.png)\
[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)\

## Interested in Game Hacking?

If you know C++, I recommend looking at:
1. [Windows Header](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/)
   1. [WriteProcessMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory)
   2. [ReadProcessMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory)
   3. [OpenProcess](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess)

## Goals

- [x] Use Cheat Engine to find static offsets
- [x] Make a simple game hack
- [x] Solve simple CrackMes with IDA/Ghidra
- [ ] Solve Difficult CrackMes with IDA/Ghidra
- [ ] Learn how to use IDA/Ghidra for game hacking

## Fun Facts
